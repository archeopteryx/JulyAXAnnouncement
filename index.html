			<u>How to get your Hotel Purchase Reimbursement Processed!</u>
			<br>
			<font style="color:red;"><b>DUE: JULY 31 11:59 PM</b></font>
		</h3>
		If you have chosen to <b>not</b> utilize the SPJA provided volunteer housing (i.e. Radisson or USC Dorms), <b>nor</b> utilize the non-carpool parking pass, and have paid for your own lodgings during Anime Expo 2018, you are eligible to receive up to $25 per night per volunteer lodging with you (up to four volunteers). To apply for this reimbursement, please follow the below steps to fill out the Hotel Purchase Reimbursement Form (Hotel PRF). 
		<br><br>
		<u>General Requirements:</u>
		<ul>
			<li>Did not utilize SPJA provided lodging at Anime Expo 2018.</li>
			<li>Did not utilize SPJA provided non-carpool parking pass at Anime Expo 2018 (note: if you were part of a carpool that used a parking pass by having at least three volunteers associated with the pass, then you are still eligible).</li>
			<li>Have at least 40 hours of volunteer work listed on Shiftboard for AX 2018 (if you are not sure, please check with your manager/direct supervisor).</li>
			<li>Volunteer status is in good standing.</li>
			<li>Must have a receipt for the lodging containing both amount paid and who paid for it.</li>
		</ul>
		Volunteer Resources will be verifying every volunteer listed on the Hotel PRF to 
		<br>
		<u>Hotel PRF Guide!</u>
		The main steps are: complete and upload the 2018 Hotel PRF, upload a hotel receipt, and email VR upon completion. Please follow the below steps to make sure it is all completed properly. 
		<ul>
			<li>
				First, download the 2018 Volunteer Hotel Purchase Reimbursement Form (Hotel PRF) from <a href="https://www.shiftboard.com/servola/fetch.cgi?ss=865793&node=3&id=153750" target="_blank">here!</a> (Make sure you're logged into Shiftboard first!)
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CHZ18ql.png" style="max-width: 50%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>Enter the date that you checked into the hotel/lodging and the date when you checked out from the hotel.
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vmlVizT.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				Enter the name of the hotel/lodging where you stayed (if it was an AirBnB, please enter both that it was an AirBnB and the name of the location you stayed in).
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KXI2a84.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				Enter the number of nights eligible for reimbursement. Please note that if you began your hotel stay before or stayed after the dates where you actively volunteered, those days are not eligible for reimbursement. 
				<br>
				In our example, staying from July 2nd to July 8 and volunteering on all of those days would produce six eligible nights. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LuAO0hv.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				Enter your first and last name, matching exactly to what is in your Shiftboard profile.
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OozTkMp.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				Enter the department you were in for AX 2018. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eLiR6Bx.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				Mark each day eligible for reimbursement.
				<br>
				In this example, Fluffbun McBunnerson arrived on site and began operations on Day Negative Two (Day -2 = July 2nd) and left on Day Four (Day 4 = July 8th). Therefore, Day -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are checked off. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dduuQVE.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				Once this is confirmed, sign the form accordingly. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6D8iA3Y.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				Repeat this process for each volunteer who stayed in the room. Each person must sign their own name to verify this information. This signature must be unique and cannot be typed (automated signatures from programs like Adobe Acrobat DC are not allowed). 
				<br>
				In this example, two of the volunteers began their department's operations on Day -1 instead of Day -2. This means that the maximum reimbursement for Day -2 is $50, while the maximum reimbursements for Days -1 through 4 are $100 per night. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/V4I0k4E.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li>
			<li>
				Next, enter the name of the person to be reimbursed. This is the name of the person who paid for the lodging, where this name <b>MUST</b> match the name listed on the hotel/lodging receipt. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://imgur.com/tMIzJC2.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				Enter the name of the person submitting the form. Only one form is needed per room/reimbursement. Be sure to remember to initial this section and enter the date the form is completed!
				<br>
				<img src="https://imgur.com/HqhI54D.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				Now that this form is complete, let's go to Shiftboard!
				<br>
				<img src="https://imgur.com/4XUDXA3.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				In the upper right corner, mouse over your own name and select "My Account" from the drop down.
				<br>
				<img src="https://imgur.com/5YQsdIX.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				Now select "Resume/Documents" from the navigation menu. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://imgur.com/j6l9cpe.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				Once in the "Resume/Documents" page, scroll down to find the Hotel PRF Upload and Hotel Receipt Upload sections. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://imgur.com/5FbHJWC.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				In the Hotel PRF section, select "Choose File" to select the your newly completed 2018 Hotel PRF.
				<br>
				<img src="https://imgur.com/3XRtMRd.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				This does not upload your form! It just selects it! So make sure to <b>click "Upload"</b> after selecting the form!
				<br>
				<img src="https://imgur.com/g3evHD6.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				After clicking "Upload," you can click "Show Hotel PRF" to verify that the correct form has been uploaded! If it's not the right file, you can click on "Remove Hotel PRF" to start the process over again. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://imgur.com/F2IJ5LR.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				Make sure the hotel receipt contains both <b>the name of the person who paid</b> and the <b>amount paid</b>! It's understandable that hotel receipts will come in all shapes, sizes, and formats, but these two bits of information are required!
				<br>
				<img src="https://imgur.com/4Nwr6tX.png" style="max-width: 50%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				Just like with the Hotel PRF, go to the "Hotel Receipt" section and click "Choose" to select the appropriate file to upload. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://imgur.com/til8io7.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				Also just like with the Hotel PRF, don't forget to click "Upload" after choosing the appropriate file!
				<br>
				<img src="https://imgur.com/z89qjlR.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				You can click on "Show Hotel Receipt" to confirm that the correct file has been uploaded! If it's not the right file, you can click on "Remove Hotel Receipt" to start the process over again. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://imgur.com/nPp3ASY.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				Finally, just send an email over to <a href="mailto:vr@spja.org" target="_blank">VR@spja.org</a> as a heads up so that we know to look for your reimbursement paperwork!
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3><u>Badge Reimbursement Process!</u>
			<br>
			<font style="color:red;"><b>DUE: JULY 31 11:59 PM</b></font>
		</h3>
		If you bought an attendee badge specifically for yourself (namely, the name on the badge is assigned to you), then went on to become an AX Volunteer, you are eligible to receive a reimbursement for that badge. 
		<br>
		<u>General Requirements</u>
		<ul>
			<li>An Eventbrite receipt containing the <b>name associated with the badge, </b> the <b>name of the person who paid for it</b>, and the <b>total amount paid.</b></li>

			<li>Volunteer status is in good standing.</li>
		</ul>

		You just need to go to the same "Resume/Documents" page on Shiftboard, as described above, and upload the Eventbrite receipt to the "Badge Reimbursement" section.

		<h3><u>Missing Radios/Equipment</u></h3>
		Unfortunately, we're still short a few radios. But many thanks to everyone who responded to the original blast! If you have any borrowed equipment whatsoever from Anime Expo, please let us know immediately! 
	</p>
	<p>
		<h3><u>Volunteer Appreciation Dinner</u></h3>
		Every year, we have a fun Volunteer Appreciation Dinner that happens after Anime Expo! It's a great opportunity to reminisce with our volunteer fam, enjoy some food together, and celebrate our peers who have gone above and beyond for each other. 
		<br><br>
		<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/xIhHfx6QsAqbbTLN2" target="_blank">If you would like to nominate one or more of your volunteer friends for a kudos award, please fill out this form!</a>
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Do not vote for the same person more than once.</li>
			<li>Do not vote for yourself.</li>
			<li>Do not vote in bulk (the copy and pasted answers get fiddly fast).</li>
		</ul>
		Currently, the date and location for the Volunteer Appreciation Dinner has not been confirmed yet. Once we know finite details on it, we'll send the info along immediately!
	</p>
	<p>
		<h3><u>Volunteer Experience Survey!</u></h3>
		We know there's an awful lot of space where we can still improve, so we'd love to hear your input! What went right? What went wrong? What would you like to see in the future? (Keeping in mind that there are 1700 volunteers and all). 
		<br>
		The survey is not required, is completely anonymous, and highly recommended. <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/s2VpCL1ATtgzLow93" target="_blank">You can find the Volunteer Experience Survey here!</a>
